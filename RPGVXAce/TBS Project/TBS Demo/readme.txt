#===================================================================
# TBS demo by Timtrack v0.5
#-------------------------------------------------------------------
# Description:
# This is a demo showcasing the scripts I wrote in the past few months
# related to a Tactical Battle System on RPG Maker VX Ace.
# This demo contains a few example in the database and on the maps
# to show very basic examples of what you can do.
#-------------------------------------------------------------------
# Term of use: You must own a legal version of VX Ace
# you may use the scripts I wrote in the demo as long as you give proper credit (see the scripts term of use)
# For the graphical resources that I've created, you may use them in commercial or free projects, crediting me for the resources is not mandatory
# For the graphical resources that I did not create from scratch, you cannot use them without the proper permissions from the other authors
#
# You may not claim this demo or any resources/scripts inside it as your own

Non vanilla graphical resources in the demo:

In Graphics/Picture/TBS/ :
The following are made from scratch (by scratch I mean staring from a blank Gimp project) by me:
  -attack_area.png
  -attack_range.png
  -cursor.png
  -move_range.png
This one comes from RPG Maker VX Ace RTP, you may use it only if you 
own RPG Maker VX Ace, credit goes to Enterbrain:
  -water_dungeon_ai.png
The following come from the original GTBS Demo, I do not know their term 
of use so it is safer to assume that you cannot use them in your projects:
