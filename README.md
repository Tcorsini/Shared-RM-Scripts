# Shared-RM-Scripts

A set of scripts for RPG Maker that I'm willing to share.
The scripts are free for use with both free and commercial RPG Maker games as long as you credit me (Timtrack) and other specified authors.
If you use them in a commercial game, it would be nice to provide a free copy of it to me although it is not mandatory.

You may share the scripts only if you provide a link to this repository and/or the post I made providing the script originally.
You may edit the scripts as long as you still provide the appropriate credit.
